## About Section

This Todo List application is designed to help you manage your daily tasks efficiently. It allows you to add new tasks, delete completed ones, and keep track of what needs to be done. The application uses React for the frontend and stores your tasks in local storage, so they persist even after you refresh the page. Navigation between the home and about pages is handled using React Router.
